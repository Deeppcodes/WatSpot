# WatSpot: UW STudy Spaces

## Inspiration
Being University of Waterloo students ourselves, we know how difficult it can be to find the perfect study spot on such a large and diverse campus. Everyone has different preferences, whether it’s quiet spaces, beautiful aesthetics, or proximity to food. We wanted to create a tool that simplifies this process, helping students save time and focus on what matters—studying. That’s how WatSpot was born!

## What it does
WatSpot is a smart web application that helps students find their ideal study spots on campus. By taking into account personal preferences like quiet areas, aesthetic environments, or nearby food options, WatSpot provides tailored recommendations. It features real-time campus maps from the user's location to their chosen spot, ensuring a seamless and efficient study experience.

## How we built it
We developed WatSpot using Python for the backend, handling the recommendation algorithm and data processing. The React framework and CSS powered the frontend, ensuring a responsive, student-friendly user interface. 

## Challenges we ran into
We faced challenges in creating a recommendation algorithm that was accurate and adaptive to diverse student preferences. Integrating Python with the React frontend and ensuring seamless data flow between components took extra effort. Additionally, implementing real-time map updates and navigation presented some hurdles due to incomplete or outdated campus mapping data.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re proud to have built a fully functional web app that directly solves a problem for students. Highlights include developing a robust backend in Python, achieving smooth integration between frontend and backend, and designing a polished UI that’s easy to use. Most importantly, we’re proud to provide a solution that can genuinely make student life easier.

## What we learned
Through this project, we gained a deeper understanding of user-centric design and learned to tackle challenges in real-time data integration and algorithm optimization. We also developed our technical and collaboration skills by blending diverse tools and technologies into one cohesive solution.

## What's next for WatSpot: 
We plan to expand WatSpot by adding more features like study group coordination, real-time availability tracking for high-demand spots, and user reviews. Additionally, we aim to integrate accessibility options and extend it to off-campus locations, such as coffee shops or libraries.
